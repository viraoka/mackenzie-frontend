Our designers have graduated from design and architecture programs that require in depth study of the history of architecture, art, furnishings and textiles, so we have an extensive knowledge of how to execute everything from traditional to modern and everything in between. One of the most important parts of our design process is when we take the time to get to know you and your company thoroughly understand your preferences and wishes for your space. "

        content: "Whether it's a general contractor, a subcontractor or an architect, each party has interests at stake in your project, and you need someone on your side who knows the construction industry to advocate on your behalf. Clients can be quite vulnerable when it comes to the issues that may arise during a project, and interior designers can be there to make sure that you aren't being taken advantage of or missing opportunities for success. We know what needs to be done to keep a project on time and on budget, and we enjoy helping our clients drive their projects forward to success."

Whether we travel to you, meet over Zoom or schedule the meeting dates around your visits to AZ- we can be flexible to meet your needs. Many out of town clients utilize our services to oversee construction and advocate on their behalf since they aren't physically present for much of the process. We can also ship samples to wherever you are so that you get a chance to see and feel them even if you're not in AZ. "

All of our interior designers have accredited degrees in Interior Design or Architecture, knowledge of health, safety, and accessibility codes, and possess the ability to utilize AutoCAD, SketchUp, Illustrator, and Photoshop to give our clients all the tools they need to visualize their space before it is built. Though it may take more time, we feel projects are most successful when the client is involved in the collaboration from the start so that the end result is something you are truly thrilled with. We avoid all kinds of shady business practices that some interior designers have traditionally utilized: hidden product mark-ups, contractor and vendor referral kick-backs, low time investment on your project, unexpected additional extra fees and costs. Transparency is among our core values; you'll see it in our design process, our pricing, and our daily interactions."

As the company grew, Mackenzie Interiors discovered her passion for training the team, developing systems & processes, business development, and teaching other interior designers about business. Mackenzie Interiors still sits in on project reviews, gives redlines, and is very hands-on with the team, you just won't typically see her in client meetings. "
